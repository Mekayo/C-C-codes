# VS Code Practice Projects

This repository contains my previous practice code written in Visual Studio Code. These practice files include small projects, code snippets, and exercises that helped me improve my programming skills.

## 📁 Contents

The repository may include code from different languages and topics such as:

- C / C++ programs
- Python scripts
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript snippets
- Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
- Simple mini-projects
- Debugging and logic practice

## 🛠 Purpose

This repo serves as a record of my personal learning and hands-on coding practice. It shows my progress as I’ve worked through different concepts and tools.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Writing clean and modular code
- Using VS Code efficiently
- Debugging and error-solving
- Practicing common programming patterns

## 📌 Notes

- This code might not follow any particular structure or naming conventions.
- Some code may be incomplete or experimental.
- I plan to revisit and improve some of the code as I grow.

## 📈 Future Plans

- Add comments and documentation to old files
- Organize files by language or topic
- Start new projects and link them here
